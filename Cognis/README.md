Cognis 🧠

Cognis is a personal and social intelligence system that models long-term human cognition using semantic memory, structured persona graphs, and evaluated retrieval-augmented reasoning.

Unlike conventional chatbots or short-context assistants, Cognis is designed as an intelligence layer: it remembers, reasons, explains, and evaluates itself over time.


1. Why Cognis Exists

Modern AI systems are largely:

Stateless
Short-term
Text-only
Weakly evaluated
Humans, however, are:
Temporal (we change over time)
Structured (habits affect skills, emotions affect decisions)
Contextual (past experience shapes present reasoning)
Interpretable (we ask why)


Cognis bridges this gap by introducing long-term memory, cognitive structure, and measurable reasoning into a single system.


2. What Cognis Is (and Is Not)

Cognis IS:

A long-term personal intelligence system
A structured reasoning engine grounded in memory
A measurable and explainable AI system
A portfolio-grade, hiring-oriented project

Cognis IS NOT:

A chatbot demo
A PDF Q&A toy
A short-context LLM wrapper
An unmeasured generation pipeline


3. Core Capabilities

Semantic Long-Term Memory using embeddings and vector databases
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for grounded reasoning
Persona Graph Modeling of skills, habits, emotions, and goals
Explainable Insights rather than generic responses
Quantitative Evaluation using RAGAS metrics
