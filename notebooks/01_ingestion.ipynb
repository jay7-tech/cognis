LOOP DETECTION\\nThe issue you are facing with consistency appears to be recurring in your learning journey. You have mentioned that some days you feel extremely motivated, while on other days you feel overwhelmed and distracted. This pattern suggests a possible cycle of motivation and demotivation.\\n\\n2. ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS\\nThe root cause of this issue could be related to the balance between your desire for growth and your fear of failure. It\\'s common to struggle with consistency when there is pressure to achieve certain goals, as it can lead to self-doubt and anxiety. This may result in alternating periods of high motivation and low motivation.\\n\\n3. INTERVENTION STRATEGY\\nTo address this issue, you could try implementing the \"FOMO\" (Fear Of Missing Out) strategy. This involves setting specific goals for each day or week and rewarding yourself when you achieve them. Additionally, it\\'s important to remind yourself that learning is a process, and setbacks are part of growth. By focusing on small, achievable tasks and celebrating your progress, you can build momentum and maintain consistency in your learning journey.\\n\\n4. REFRAME\\nInstead of blaming yourself for not being consistent, reframe the issue as an opportunity for self-improvement. Embrace the idea that setbacks are temporary and that each experience is a stepping stone towards personal growth. By adopting this mindset, you can approach your learning journey with more confidence and resilience.\\n\\n'),\n",
