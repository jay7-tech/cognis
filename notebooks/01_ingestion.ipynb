The reason this keeps repeating might be that inconsistency often stems from internal factors such as self-doubt or fear of failure. It's important to remember that progress isn't always linear and there will be ups and downs.\\n\\nTo address this, you could try setting achievable goals, breaking down your learning into smaller tasks, and celebrating small victories. Additionally, it might be helpful to identify what triggers inconsistency in your learning process and find ways to mitigate those triggers.\\n\\nAs for building meaningful AI projects, the key is to focus on personalization. Think about how you can use AI to solve a problem that's important to you or help someone else.
