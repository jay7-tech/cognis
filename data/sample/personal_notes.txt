I have been struggling with consistency in my learning journey.
Some days I feel extremely motivated, but on other days I feel overwhelmed and distracted.

I often overthink whether I am doing enough.
I want to build systems that help me reflect, stay focused, and grow steadily.

Recently, I have also been thinking a lot about building meaningful AI projects
that feel personal rather than generic tutorials.
